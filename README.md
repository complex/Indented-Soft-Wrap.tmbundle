Indented Soft Wrap
==================

This enables indented soft wrap in TextMate 2. For it to work, TextMate's soft wrap setting must be turned on already. The code was taken from here:

All credit to Anthony Pulido, I simply turned this into a bundle for easier installation.

Installation
------------

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles
    git clone git@github.com:complex/Indented-Soft-Wrap.tmbundle.git

You may need to restart TextMate for it to take effect.
